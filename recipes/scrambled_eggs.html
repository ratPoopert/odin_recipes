    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Half &amp; Half</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>Black Pepper, for serving</li>
        <li>Freshly chopped Herbs, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl, aggressively whisk together the Eggs, Half &amp; Half, and Salt until the mixture is uniform in color and texture, is light and foamy, and there are no streaks of yolk or white.</li>
        <li>Melt the Butter in a small non-stick pan over medium heat, until the butter coats the whole pan and begins to foam.</li>
        <li>Add the Egg mixture to the center of the pan and immediately reduce the heat to medium-low.</li>
        <li>When the edges of the mixture begin to set, push the eggs from one side of the pan to the other using a rubber spatula. Continue this process, pausing between swipes to allow the uncooked egg to settle on the warm pan and cook.</li>
        <li>When the eggs are mostly cooked, but still appear wet, slowly fold the mixture onto itself a few times.</li>
        <li>When the eggs still shimmer with some moisture, remove the pan from heat and continue stirring.</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture to serving plates. Finish with Black Pepper and Herbs to taste.</li>
    </ol>
