        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>This soup is creamy, delicious, and very low carb.</p>

        <p>To be clear, it has a thinner, more broth-like consistency because it does not have a roux or any thickening agents. The taste is spot on, but if you don’t add something like xanthan gum, it won’t be the thick soup you might be used to.</p>
